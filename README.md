<h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>
<p>Here, I would like to write my code bolg that I need to memorize or go through at one sight. I would like if you also go through my codeBlog and learn something new and interesting.</p>
<p>Coding is like a pearl in ocean, you can't get all pearl at one place and can't grap everything at once. This is my point of view regarding my coding journey. May be you may differ from my thoughts, so let it go and let's talk about the challenges I have faced during writing this coding blog.</p>
<h2>Challenges I have faced:</h2>
<p>I know it sounds cringe, but it's one of my challenges that I have faced so I'm here to tell you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, I have created this codeBlog website using react.js and I think that first I will save the title, para, image's url at one place such as in a file <em>ReactPage.js</em> that I have to import in <em>ReactPage.jsx</em>. And literally it was my biggest fault to keep the file name of <strong>.js</strong> similar to <strong>.jsx</strong> file name. Everything was ok, such as file was running perfectly but when I deployed it on <em>Vercel</em> an error was raised like "Error in resolving ReactPage.js".</li>
  <em>Solution is that the name of all the files with <strong>.jsx</strong> extension must start with "Capital" but if you have another file with <strong>.js</strong> extension start it's name with "small" letter.</em>
</ul>
